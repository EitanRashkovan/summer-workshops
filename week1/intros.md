# Eitan Rashkovan
- I am a sophomore at at UCSB and I enjoy coding
- I am Trilingual (I speak Hebrew, Russian, and English)
- GitHub is hard mainly because I am struggling to find where everything is.
- Not sure how to create a blank file and add stuff to it.
- Other than that I think I got everything.

- I'm in my junior year of a computer science degree
- I've lived all over the country, from Hawaii to Virginia and many states in between
- GitHub seems like a lot at the start
  - Learning little bits consistantly seems to be the way to go
  - I can tell how powerful of a tool this is without even knowing how to fully use it
- **I feel very fortunate to be a part of this group**
