# Projects

Now that we've covered git, CI/CD, APIs and containers... let's put it to work! The goal for all these projects will be to create a working sample project, and to write documentation so another person can follow along, learn about the topic, and get the sample application running. This will help you document what you did and how you did it, which will be helpful when you're preparing for interviews, because interviewers will want to hear you describe the details. It also pays-it-forward, because I'll be using these in my future mentorship and training materials.

Here's my suggested approach for tackling these projects:

1. Get the thing working. You can't document what you don't know! So first just try to get the application/project working correctly. As you do so, take short notes about what you did, the notes will help on step 3.
2. When you're satisfied with the state of the project, clean up your code (add helpful comments, opt for readable code over optimized code, remove old code that's no longer necessary, etc.)
3. Start writing steps on how someone else can fork your project and get it running. Explain where necessary, imagine that you are writing this for your past self from ~5 weeks ago before this summer's learning sessions :)
